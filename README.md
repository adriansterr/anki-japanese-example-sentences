# anki-japanese-example-sentences
### Anki addon to automatically generate example sentences in Japanese.

Based on this extension: [Example Sentences - Japanese](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1290983049), I switched to another website that in my opinion delivers better example sentences, because they are shorter and more to the point. The new website is [massif.la ](https://massif.la/ja).

Other than using [massif.la ](https://massif.la/ja), this extension works exactly like the original. The main features are:
- With right-click on a card and selecting **Add/change Example Sentence**: select one of the suggested sentences and add it to your specified card field.
- By selecting multiple cards and clicking **Bulk-add Example Sentences (1 each)**, add the highest ranking sentence to each card.
