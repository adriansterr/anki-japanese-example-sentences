# anki-japanese-example-sentences
### Anki addon to automatically generate example sentences in Japanese.

Based on this extension: [Example Sentences - Japanese](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1290983049), I switched to another website that in my opinion delivers better example sentences, because they are shorter and more to the point. The new website is [massif.la ](https://massif.la/ja).

Other than using [massif.la ](https://massif.la/ja), this extension works exactly like the original. The main features are:
- Right-click on one card and select **Add/change Example Sentence**: select one of the suggested sentences and add it to your specified card field
- Select multiple cards and click **Bulk-add Example Sentences (1 each)**, add the highest ranking sentence to each card

## Installation

- Download this repository as a ZIP-file and extract it
- Find where the Add-ons are saved in your Anki file structure
- Do this by opening Anki and selecting Tools > Add-ons > select any Add-on you already have > View Files
- It should open a path similar to this: C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\addons21\1536291224
- Paste the downloaded repository here and restart Anki
- You should see **Massif Example Sentences Japanese** as a new Add-on
- Finally, edit **Config** and change "note_type", "sentence" and "word" to your own names
- "sentence" is the destination field, where the example sentence should be put
- "word" is the expression that should be used for searching example sentences
